# MCBE-WSSTests
MCBE WSS Tests with a C# console application.

This example is to do some tests with the current WSS feature for MCBE and to figure out what it does. 
However we need to do a packet dump and possibly some reverse engineering to figure out what packets to send and receive.
Current versions of MCWSS would probably be not that different but there may be new events and stuff etc... You never know...
